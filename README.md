> **Archival Reason**
> As much as I love developing this app and despite it being my first personal project that I have committed a lot into, I have lost motivation to continue with it over the years. Currently I have shifted my priorities to other personal projects (that will be made public on my GitHub profile soon for you to check out soon) that are geared toward enhancing my personal life and productivity.
> Re:Connect will remain as a public archive for recruiters to view so they can see how much capable I am when it comes to writing a big project like this on my own. It will always have a place in my heart. Without it, I don't think the other personal projects would not exist because I didn't find the motivation and joy in writing applications.
> That being said, I will also shut down the Firebase database that is hosting the online functionality of this app. While you are free to clone this repo and have a look at the code yourself, it won't be able to do anything because the server is not active anymore.

> This project is intended to a be a small (not really small lol) personal project of mine to demonstrate my ability to do iOS/Apple development using the skills that I learned myself and from work. **It is not intended to be used to compete with the big social media apps on the App Store** like X or Facebook.

## About Re:Connect
Re:Connect (pronounced "reconnect") is a social media application similar to X (Twitter) but it focuses more on keeping users safe online. It has a native iOS user interface that feels right at home for Apple users and an incredible user experience that feels delightful to use. Most importantly, this app aims to be different from other social media platforms, by **prioritizing the user's privacy on top of everything else! Data of the users will never be sold and no ads are present on the platform.**

This app incorporates **Firebase Database** to host the backend database to store user's profile info, posts and almost all the data on Re:Connect. **Firebase Auth** provides account authentication and creation that uses the latest cryptography technology to protect the user's password and account info in the industry-standard way.
