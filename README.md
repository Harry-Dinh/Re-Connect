# Re:Connect Social Media Application

## Quick Note About This Repository
This repository was previously home to many other projects besides Re:Connect. They were moved to make this repository less cluttered and confusing. However, the original path to the Re:Connect source code were still in the same place to prevent errors when Xcode trying to find the original path.

## About Re:Connect
Re:Connect (pronounced "reconnect") is a social media application similar to X (Twitter) but it focuses more on keeping users safe online. It has a native iOS user interface that feels right at home for Apple users and an incredible user experience that feels delightful to use.
