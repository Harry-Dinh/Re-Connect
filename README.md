> **A quick note about this repository:**
> This repository was previously home to many other projects besides Re:Connect. They were moved to make this repository less cluttered and confusing. However, the original path to the Re:Connect source code were still in the same place to prevent errors when Xcode trying to find the original path.

## About Re:Connect
Re:Connect (pronounced "reconnect") is a social media application similar to X (Twitter) but it focuses more on keeping users safe online. It has a native iOS user interface that feels right at home for Apple users and an incredible user experience that feels delightful to use. Most importantly, this app aims to be different from other social media platforms, by **prioritizing the user's privacy on top of everything else! Data of the users will never be sold and no ads are present on the platform.**

This app incorporates **Firebase Database** to host the backend database to store user's profile info, posts and almost all the data on Re:Connect. **Firebase Auth** provides account authentication and creation that uses the latest cryptography technology to protect the user's password and account info in the industry-standard way.
